# Timers

Timers can be used by processing blocks (for example, the **Delay** block) to execute something later. They are also used by input blocks. Timers must be managed by the Analytics Builder framework. This allows the runtime to handle:

* Models executing in simulation mode, which run at some offset from real time.
* Multiple timers firing at the same time from different blocks executing a single model "activation".

The runtime thus knows what the current time of evaluation is. This is available from the `BlockBase.getModelTime()` action. Blocks should not use the `currentTime` variable.

To create a timer, use the `BlockBase` methods `createTimer` and `createTimerWith`. The `createTimer` takes a relative offset time and a `payload`. The `createTimerWith` allows passing a `TimerParams` object to give more control.

When the timer fires, it will call a method named `$timerTriggered` on the block. This can take parameters including:

* `Activation $activation`
* Block `$State` `$blockState`
* `$payload` (of any EPL type - `string`, `float`, event types, `any`, etc.)
* `TimerHandle $timerHandle`
* `ConfigPropertyValue $configPropertyValues`

From this `$timerTriggered`, it is thus possible to call the `$setOutput` actions with the provided `$activation` value.

The `$payload` is the value provided to `createTimer` or added to the `TimerParams`.

The following is a simple example of timers, to delay float values by 1 second:

```Java
event Delay1Sec {
    BlockBase $base;
    action $process(float $input_value) {
        $base.createTimer(1.0, $input_value);
    }
    action $timerTriggered(Activation $activation, float $payload) {
        $setOutput_delayed($activation, $payload);
    }
    action<Activation, float> $setOutput_delayed;
}
```

## Timer handles

The `createTimerWith` action returns a `TimerHandle` object (and this can also be a parameter to the `$timerTriggered` action). This allows the timer to be canceled by calling `$base.cancelTimer(timerHandle)`. The `TimerHandle` can be stored in the `$State` object if required.

## Timer parameters

`TimerParams` allows the user to create a timer which is:

* Absolute: fires at an absolute point in time (taking into account any offset due to running in simulation mode).
* Relative: as per the `createTimer` method.
* Recurring: a recurring timer will trigger at the interval specified.

`TimerParams` allows adding a payload via the `withPayload` action, and a [partition](070-Partitions.md) can be specified.
